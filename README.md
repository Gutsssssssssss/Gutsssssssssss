I graduated in 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science from **SeoulTech**, and i completed a year‑long intensive program at the **Samsung Software Academy for Youth**.

I build applications using **Java** and **Go**, and have a solid understanding of **HTTP** and **WebSocket**.</br>
Recently, I’ve been focusing on writing clean code and exploring how to stay fully immersed in programming.


I’m currently seeking opportunities as a **software engineer**.

I document my learnings on my blog: [here](https://velog.io/@junsk50/posts)
