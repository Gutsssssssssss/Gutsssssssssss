I graduated in 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science from **SeoulTech**.  
In 2024, I completed a year‑long intensive program at the **Samsung Software Academy for Youth (SSAFY)**.

I build backend applications using **Java(Spring)** and **Go**, with experience in developing systems over **HTTP** and **WebSocket**.</br>
Recently, I’ve been interested in writing beautiful code and exploring how to stay fully immersed in programming.


I’m currently seeking opportunities as a **software engineer**.

I document my learnings on my blog: [here](https://velog.io/@junsk50/posts)
