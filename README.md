ðŸŽ“ I graduated in 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science from **SeoulTech**.  
ðŸ’» In 2024, I completed a yearâ€‘long intensive program at the **Samsung Software Academy for Youth (SSAFY)**.

ðŸŒ± I mainly used **Java + Spring** during SSAFY, building scalable backend services and collaborative team projects.  
âš¡ These days, Iâ€™m diving deep into **Go (Golang)**, focusing on efficient, concurrent backend systems.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m currently seeking opportunities as a **backend developer** or **software engineer**.

ðŸ“˜ I document my learnings on my blog: [here](https://velog.io/@junsk50/posts)
